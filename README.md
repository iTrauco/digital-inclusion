# digital-inclusion-as-a-core-component-of-social-inclusion

I have shifted from being a D&I hardliner to being an advocate for 'Digital Inclusion' as the basis for defining modern corporate citizenship initiatives; the socioeconomic disparities that exist today for the most marginalized members of society are rooted in the paradigm shift of the last three technological epochs that  began with the First Industrial Revolution in England in the year 1765 with the rediscovery of steam power and the mechanization of factory manufacturing techniques that would spur the invention of the cotton gin and ignite the American Civil War over slavery… 

Soon thereafter in the 1870s to early 1890s technology gave way to the industrial titans of steel, assembly line mass production, and early electrical widgets during the Second Industrial Revolution that culminated in WWII and and the end of America has an agrarian-based society… 

The atomic bomb and microprocessors during the Third Industrial Revolution gave rise to suburban life that began with Levittown and the white picket fences of knowledge-based white collar collar society for those with access to latest technology… 

Mobile phones in the developing world have crippled highly successful efforts to mend the digital divide of the last 30 years because now, everyone has access to the internet, but they do not have the hardware horsepower required to skillup and self-learn with technology… 

Lack of technological access or skillup know-how will destroy most corporate promises for D&I being made today as a result of the Black Lives Movement protests because of the 'digital workspace mentality' that is required for success in the Fourth Industrial Revolution unless a mindset of 'Digital Inclusion' is adopted... 

I need to find a better way to organize everything I have been reading to understand what is happening...
